# Ruby is a programming language from Japan (available at ruby-lang.org) which is revolutionizing the web. The beauty of Ruby is found in its balance between simplicity and power.
# Try out Ruby code in the prompt on the right. In addition to Ruby's built-in methods, the following commands are available:
# help → Starts the 15 minute interactive tutorial. Trust me, it's very basic!
# clear → Clears the screen. Useful if your browser starts slowing down. Your command history will be remembered.
# next → Allows you to skip to the next section of a lesson.
# back → Allows you to return to the previous section of a lesson.
# # If you want to save your progress, head on over to Code School and sign up for free. We'll wait for you here.


# Great! You did a little bit of math.
# See how the answer was returned? Ruby uses a fat arrow for responses to your entries.
# Ruby recognizes numbers and mathematics operators. You could also try some other math like:
# 4 * 10
# 5 - 12
# 40 / 4
# Even though we've placed a space between the numbers and the operators above, it's not required. For now, stick with these basic operations; we'll try a few others later.
# When you're finished experimenting, type next to move to the next lesson when you're finished.


# Welp, we already know that computers are handy and fast for math.
# But what about something really useful. Like, say, seeing the letters of your name reversed!
# To do that super-cool task, let's first get you familiar with text in Ruby. Type your first name in quotes, like this: "Jimmy"


# Perfect, you've formed a string from the letters of your name. A string is an ordered set of characters that the computer can process.
# Imagine the letters are on a string of laundry line and the quotes are clothespins holding the ends. The quotes mark the beginning and the end of the string, and are required.
# Now, let's get to reversing your name.
# Type: "Jimmy".reverse, using your own name where the string goes. (Don't forget the dot!)

# Counting the Letters
# Objective:
# You have used the reverse method on your name!
# By enclosing your name in quotes, you made a string. Next, you used a dot to access a hidden list of methods that belong to all strings. In this case, you then called the reverse method, which works on strings to flip the order of the string’s characters. Cool, huh?
# Now, let's use a different option which will show us how many letters are in your name. Try typing "Jimmy".length using your name where the string goes.



# Now, maybe you're wondering what any of this is actually good for. Have you ever encountered a website that yelled at you for choosing a password that was too short? Turns out, the length property is often what that site uses to check for a correct length.
# Let's get crazy now, and multiply your name by 5. Follow the following format: "Jimmy" * 5
